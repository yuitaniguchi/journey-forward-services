        question: "How do I get a quote for your services?",
        answer:
            "You can request a quote through our website form. We require specific details about the items (e.g., table size, number of large/medium/small items), weight, and quantity. We also need details about the pickup location, such as the floor, presence of an elevator, and parking availability. Quotes are calculated and sent to you via email, often as a range, and may require further dialogue for accuracy.",

        question: "What types of items do you pick up?",

            "We pick up a wide range of items, from single pieces of furniture to entire house clearances. This includes furniture, appliances, clothing, dishes, and general junk. Our goal is to reuse and refurbish items that are still useful, rather than sending them to a landfill.",

By choosing JFS, you are supporting a faith-based, social impact model that helps integrate individuals back into society through meaningful work. We also emphasize reusing and repurposing items to reduce waste and benefit the community.",

    {
        question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
        answer:
            "You can cancel your pickup service without a fee if you do so at least 24 hours before the scheduled pickup time. Cancellations made within 24 hours may incur a cancellation fee if staff and a truck have already been dispatched, as this covers labor and gas costs. Payment is typically charged after the pickup is completed.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to the items you pick up?",
        answer:
            "Useful items are sorted for reuse, refurbishment, or resale. We partner with various thrift stores and organizations like UGM, ROA, and Home Start to distribute furniture, clothing, and other goods to families in need. Items that cannot be reused are responsibly taken to the dump.",
    },
    {

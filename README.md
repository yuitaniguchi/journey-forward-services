# ManageSmartr – Capstone Project Guide

**Student Instructions**

**Course Term Project**  
October 15 – December 19

## 1. Project Overview

You will build ManageSmartr, a full-scale web platform designed to modernize the process of ordering, managing, and tracking steel wall deliveries. This is not a sample assignment — it simulates a real-world product build.

You are expected to deliver all major platform features, including:

- Admin System (Clients, Projects, PDFs, Orders, Status Control)
- Client Portal (Kanban Board, Modification Requests, Orders, Tracking)
- Employee Views (Driver, Manufacturer, Sales – Status Updates)
- Invoicing, Logs, Notifications, Dashboard UI

## 2. Reference Materials (Mandatory)

You will receive two core attachments :

- ManageSmartr Project Scope Document (Functional & Feature Requirements) - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgPmZvT5URFDjGnw9VqST5o3aCgWkb9Jp3Y5PDXNAmg/edit?usp=sharing 
- Figma Design Link (Visual direction and interface layout) - 
https://www.figma.com/design/0cwQuhdZMnKYgnot8RuAUk/ManageSmart?node-id=64-772&t=WyHSDqmJPzyNtYzk-1

These documents define your requirements. Do not invent features outside of these references.

## 3. Team Structure & Roles

- Teams will be formed with four or more members.
- Teams may self-organize roles internally, but each team ***must declare one Product Manager***.
- The Product Manager is responsible for communication with the instructor, understand the product requirements and tracking team deliverables.
- Every member must contribute to development; no one may remain in a non-coding role.

## 4. Technology Expectations

The project must be built on the core technologies defined in the scope:

- Next.js / React
- Relational Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Authentication (NextAuth, Clerk, or Supabase)
- Cloud Storage for PDFs (S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.)

You may include supporting libraries or tools, but you cannot replace the core platform stack.

## 5. Development Expectations

- **Full Build Required:** All core functionalities must be attempted.
- **Figma Compliance:** UI must follow the layout and design principles provided.
- **Feature Flow Accuracy:** Follow the exact status stages and business logic from documentation (Orders, PDFs, etc.).
- **Architecture Planning:** Teams are expected to produce a basic system structure before coding.

## 6. Progress & Accountability

Follow the 10-week phase timeline provided. The instructor may visit any team during any class and request:

- Progress update
- Code walkthrough
- Feature demonstration

Lack of progress will not be excused by planning delays.

## 7. Scope Updates

Minor adjustments or clarifications to features may be provided by the instructor during the term. These changes will be clearly communicated and reflected in shared documentation. Teams must adapt professionally.

## 8. Final Deliverables

You will present a working platform on December 19. Your final presentation must include:

- Live walkthrough of features (not slides only)
- Real workflows: Admin → Client → Employee
- Team explanation of architecture and challenges

This project is a simulation of a real production team. Treat it with professional standards.

## Reminder to Teams

> Your success depends on clarity, collaboration, and steady progress. Treat this as production work—design carefully, build responsibly, and communicate consistently.
